Noderdom Scaffolding is used to generate Typescript interfaces, classes and mixins representing the DOM structure as expressed in WebIDL.

This tool is heavily based on the fantastic work by the Typescript team to generate their dom.generated.d.ts files: [TSJS-lib-generator](https://github.com/typescript/tsjs-lib-generator).

# How to Use

Install from NPM:
```
npm install noderdom-scaffolding
```

Generate classes and mixins to current folder:
```
noderdom-scaffolding generate
```
